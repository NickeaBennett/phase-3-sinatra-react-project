## Learning Goals

- Build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Requirements

- Use Active Record to interact with a database.
- Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.
- At a minimum, set up the following API routes in Sinatra:
  - create and read actions for both models
  - full CRUD capability for one of the models
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to
  perform CRUD actions.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your
  models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.
